# Fine-Tuning-Generative-Model-for-Madhubani-Art-Synthesis-using-LoRA
In order to create authentic Madhubani paintings using Stable Diffusion models, this project explores parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Three adaptation methods—Low-Rank Adaptation, Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation, and HyperLoRA were carefully compared with different rank values and data set sizes.
